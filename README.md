CS465- Full Stack Development with MEAN

**Introduction:**

Travlr Getaways is a traveling agency that has set up a web application to allow its customers/users to look up different types of trips for get aways. 
The user is able to create an account, book trips and look over the different types of trips available. An administrative log in has also been created to allow for the admins to be able to add, edit, update and delete trips that are in the Travlr Getaways web page. The amdins can edit the dates of trips as well as the pricing, description and the name of the trip. This application was created using MEAN stack.

**Architecture:**

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

Frontend development was comprised of Express HTMLm, JavaScript, and single-page application (SPA). Express was the framework that handled different HTTP requests that came from the client-side. JavaScript and HTML were used to design the user Interface (UI) and execute the functionality of the client-side. The single-page application was used to allow for pages to seemlessly be navigated from differrent sections without the need to load a new web page. 

NoSQL MogoDB was used for the backend of the web application. MongoDB allows for flexibility and scalability with its databases. Storage and retrieval of the data becomes more simple, and is easily integrated with the frontend of the web application. 

**Functionality:**

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON also know as JavaScript Object Notation, is a format that allows for data to be stored and transported between the frontend and backend of the web application that was created. JavaScript was mainly used as the programming language to manipulate how the webpage behaves. JSON is data that is easy for both humans and machine to be able to read. 

Refactored code was used to improve the functionality byb creating reusable User Interface (UI) components. These components allowed for new features to be added to the web application more easily, and created a path that assisted developers from writing code with nothing to code that would be manipulated to fit that component. 

**Testing:**

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. 
Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

The methods for request and retrieval that were used for the testing of endpoints were GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Endpoints are the URLs that the client has access to the different parts of the API. In this project, there were different methods used in testing the endpoints, and makingusre that they were functioning properly. 

When it came down to testing with different layers of security, additional steps were required. Making sure that passwords were not to be taken, and that only those with admin authority could make changesa to the web application's trips. Authentication became the purpose for this to happen.

**Reflection:**

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

At the start of this course, I still had little to any idea of where I wanted to start my career in Computer Science. However, around the mid part of this 8 week semester, I have found that Full Stack Development interests me more than any other course I have taken, and I want to see how far I can take this in finding a future job. The Professor in this course has been more than helpful answering questions I have had and giving the class a heads up with issues that the assignments might have at the start of each week. This course has been one of the best I have taken while attending SNHU, and I am grateful that this has helped me to figure out where I want to start in this career.

This project has allowed me to learn how to use various frontend and backend technologies. These including Express HTML, JavaScript, Angular, and MongoDB. I had learned how to create databases with MongoDb in a previous course, but this one has shown me how to connect a web application to MongoDB. With this I learned how a web application is able to pull data from the database and display that information on a webpage. I also became familiar with different tools and frameworks, such as Node.js and Angular. These have helped me to improve the performance and scalability of the web application. I look forward to learning more about Full Stack Development. This course has made me decide that this is what I want to pursue as a career path after competion of this Bachelor's Degree.
