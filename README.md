CS465- Full Stack Development with MEAN
Introduction:

Travlr Getaways is a traveling agency that has set up a web application to allow its customers/users to look up different types of trips for get aways. The user is able to create an account, book trips and look over the different types of trips available. An administrative log in has also been created to allow for the admins to be able to add, edit, update and delete trips that are in the Travlr Getaways web page. The amdins can edit the dates of trips as well as the pricing, description and the name of the trip. This application was created using MEAN stack.

Architecture:
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?


Functionality:
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.


Testing:
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
